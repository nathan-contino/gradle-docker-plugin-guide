# Gradle Take-Home Writing Assignment

You'll find the take-home writing assignment in [`getting-started-building-docker-images-with-gradle.md`](/getting-started-building-docker-images-with-gradle.md).

Note that, for consistency with the other Gradle "Getting Started" guides, both my guide structure
and some of my sentences resembles the other Gradle guides. This is intentional, and I promise I didn't
copy/paste anything -- I just used similar wording because it would be a little silly for my guide to
read totally differently from any of the other Gradle content. Familiarity is a good thing for readers!
